# SPI-Dashboard-Cimetrix-Zeppelin

## Overview
The SPI Dashboard integrates data from SPI (Solder Paste Inspection) machines to create an interconnected visual dashboard, aiming to improve manufacturing process control and defect prevention in PCBA (Printed Circuit Board Assembly).

## Project Goals
- Create a user-friendly dashboard interface.
- Visualize key parameters and metrics from SPI machines.
- Enable interactive features for better data exploration and analysis.

## The Importance of Data Collection and Connectivity
In Industry 4.0, seamless data collection and integration between machines are essential for predictive maintenance, real-time monitoring, and data-driven decision-making, enhancing quality control, efficiency, and productivity. Corporates' lofty goals of AI and Machine Learning are impossible without the foundation our project explores.

## Proposed Project Timeline for V2
- **Week 7:** Implement solder map with interactive features (e.g., hover, click, toggle).
- **Week 8:** Design dashboard layout with multiple panels for different insights.
- **Week 9:** Display static board information in a left panel and static visuals for board's volume %, area ratio, and x/y offset.
- **Week 10:** Enable hover/click for interactive visualization of solder point metrics: volume %, area ratio, and x/y offset.
- **Week 11:** Incorporate Cimetrix index for data input.
- **Week 12-14:** Debugging and polishing the dashboard for seamless user experience.
